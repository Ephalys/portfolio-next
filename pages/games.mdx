# Games

## People usually call me Hacker, tryharder, no-lifeâ€¦ But my real username is *ephalys*.
\
\
I'm an eager gamer since my childhood and I spent the last 20
years grinding every game that I touched. I finally placed
first in Europe on Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 (e-sniping)
after few tournament wins.
\
\
Then, when I wasn't playing competitive matches, I took
pleasure in challenging 4-5 top-ranked players while being
alone on Call Of Duty: Black Ops 3 (public matches).
All these games allowed me to perfect my game sense, mastering
every corners of the maps and play with timings in order to
outplay my oponents. You can watch some of my these matches
on <ExternalLink link="youtube.com/ephalys" text="Youtube" />.

\
Nowadays, in search of new challenges I left Sony and Call Of Duty
licences to focus on PC and especially Battlefield. I arrived late 
but I managed to place among the top players of the battlefield
community. You can check my stats
