# Games

I'm an avid gamer since my childhood and I spent the last 20
years grinding every game that I touched. I finally placed
first in Europe on Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 (e-sniping)
after few tournament wins.
\
\
Then, I took pleasure in playing alone against 4-5 good
players on Call Of Duty: Black Ops 3 (public matches). All
these games allowed me to perfect my game sense, mastering
every corners of the maps and play with timings in order to
outplay my oponents. You can watch some of my these matches
on <ExternalLink link="youtube.com/ephalys" text="Youtube" /> .
\
\
Nowadays, I left the Call Of Duty licence to focus on
Battlefield. I arrived late but I managed to place among the
top players of the battlefield community. You can check my stats

I'm also streaming on <ExternalLink link="twitch.tv/ephalys" text="Twitch" /> from time to time.
