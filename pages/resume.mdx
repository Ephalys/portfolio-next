# Resume

## I’m currently working as a *front-end engineer* at <ExternalLink link="https://hager.com" text="Hager" size="18" /> a leading supplier of solutions and services for electrical installations.

### Summary
I began my developer journey with an internship as a full-stack developer at <ExternalLink link="classicatscattery.com" text="Classicat's"/>. My main focus was to create a new site from scratch with an administration interface and then increase traffic using good SEO practices.

Then i joined <ExternalLink link="https://subskill.com/" text="Subskill"/> — still being a full-stack developer — and for them I have worked on projects involving several fields: luxury fashion brands, banks, public services, health insurance, major retail distributors and ecommerce.

Next, i had the oportunity to work at Hager as a front-end engineer. Our team revamped the main site, meanwhile developing from scratch a SSO widget. It is mainly used by the installers on the ground allowing them to create accounts for customers and navigate through Hager applications whithout worrying about logins.
