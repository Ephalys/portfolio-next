# Léon Tran-Van

## I’m currently working as a *front-end engineer* at <ExternalLink link="https://hager.com" text="Hager" size="18" /> a leading supplier of solutions and services for electrical installations.
\
\
I began my developer journey with an internship as a full-stack developer at <ExternalLink link="classicatscattery.com" text="Classicat's"/>. My main focus was to create a new site from scratch with an administration interface and then increase traffic using good SEO practices.

Then i joined <ExternalLink link="https://subskill.com/" text="Subskill"/> — still being a full-stack developer — and for them I have worked on projects involving several fields: luxury fashion brands, banks, public services, health insurance, major retail distributors and ecommerce.

Next, i had the oportunity to work at Hager as a front-end engineer. Our team revamped the main site, meanwhile developing from scratch a SSO widget. It is mainly used by the installers on the ground allowing them to create accounts for customers and navigate through Hager applications whithout worrying about logins.

### Workflow
It's been 2 years that im coding in <ExternalLink link="https://vuejs.org/" text="Vue"/> at work but each of my side projects are made with <ExternalLink link="https://reactjs.org/" text="React"/>.
\
I also experienced the 2 main React frameworks: <ExternalLink link="https://nextjs.org/" text="NextJS"/> and <ExternalLink link="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" text="Gatsby"/>.
Both projects are available on my <ExternalLink link="https://github.com/ephalys" text="Github"/>  profile.

I've always used SCSS in order to style my applications but i recently started to use <ExternalLink link="https://tailwindcss.com/" text="Tailwind"/>.
It is way more consistent and maintainable than standard CSS.
I also have experience with <ExternalLink link="https://webpack.js.org/" text="Webpack"/> and <ExternalLink link="https://gulpjs.com/" text="Gulp"/> .
At the end, everything is cleaned up using ESLint and Prettier.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
