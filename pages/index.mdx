# LÃ©on Tran-Van

## I'm a *frontend engineer* with a designer soul curbed by color blindness.
\
\
Since my childhood, I've always had a passion for everything that has to do with design and art and it kept growing over the years.
Thus on a daily basis im inspired by great branded companies such as 
<ExternalLink link="https://nike.com/" text="Nike"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://apple.com/" text="Apple"/> or <ExternalLink link="https://bulk.com/" text="Bulk"/>.
\
\
I'm always pushing boundaries in everything i do in life in order to get the best results, whether it's gaming, work or even gym.

### Workflow
It's been { new Date().getFullYear() - 2020 } years that im coding in <ExternalLink link="https://vuejs.org/" text="Vue"/> at work but each of my side projects are made with <ExternalLink link="https://reactjs.org/" text="React"/>.
With these projects I experienced the 2 trendy React frameworks: <ExternalLink link="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" text="Gatsby"/> and more recently <ExternalLink link="https://nextjs.org/" text="Next"/>.
\
Source code of these projects are available on my <ExternalLink link="https://github.com/ephalys" text="Github"/> profile!
\
\
I've always used SCSS in order to style my applications but i recently started to use <ExternalLink link="https://tailwindcss.com/" text="Tailwind"/> as it is way more consistent and maintainable than standard CSS.
\
During the development phase, everything is cleaned up using ESLint and Prettier.
At the end, I tend to ship projects with <ExternalLink link="https://vercel.com/" text="Vercel"/> as it takes care of everything.

### Misc
Here are some technologies I had to use among my numerous projects:
\
Styled components, Webpack, Gulp, Jquery, Pinia, Magento 2, Sitecore, Wordpress, PHP, MySQL, Azure DevOps

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
