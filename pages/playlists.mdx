# Playlists

## Music takes an important part of my life. Hence, I've made some *Spotify* playlists to match any mood.

<RichList items={props.playlists}/>

export const getStaticProps =  async () => {
  const playlists = await getPlaylists();

  return {
    props: {
      playlists,
    },
  };
};

export default ({ children }) => <Layout SEOTitle="Playlists">{children}</Layout>
