    text: `I began my developer journey with an internship as a full-stack developer at Classicat's. My main focus was to create a new site from scratch with an administration interface and then increase traffic using good SEO practices.

    Then i joined Subskill — still being a full-stack developer — and for them I have worked on projects involving several fields: luxury fashion brands, banks, public services, health insurance, major retail distributors and ecommerce.
    
    Next, i had the oportunity to work at Hager as a front-end engineer. Our team revamped the main site, meanwhile developing from scratch a SSO widget. It is mainly used by the installers on the ground allowing them to create accounts for customers and navigate through Hager applications whithout worrying about logins.`,
